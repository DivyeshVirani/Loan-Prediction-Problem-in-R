# Loan-Prediction-Problem-in-R
This repository will explain Analytics-Vidhya Loan prediction problem in R and how to analyze and build a model.
In any predictive model, It is important to analyze features and make new features so as to make  model better.In this problem,we will 
analyze existing features and will observe whether we need some new features to make our model better.

Loan_prediction.ipynb will tell us how to do exploratory data analysis.In this notebook I have covered how to visualize our data and features
and select some important features for our prediction model.
